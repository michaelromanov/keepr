Backend is live, execute on Vue.
Todos:
1) Make sure all files linked inside of the Home.vue - why is the . not working?
2) Load public keeps into Home then if logged in, loop over user keeps?



Corrections in the Code: 
1) Corrected the link rel=icon href it had a < in it.

Transient service service leads to repository - make sure it is set up. 


Principles of OOP - Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Plymorphism
SOLID - Single Use, Open closed, Liskov, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion



Start with building out the Model Folder and the model.cs name for that singular model like Knight.cs
Inside the Knight.cs model, start with the namespace to contain everything.

Once the models folder is built, build out the controller folder for the basic controller for the knights and the quests 
models that have already been created.
The controller handles and accepts http requests from the client.

Project Notes: 
Backend
Keep is a pin
Vault is a board

Quests, Knights, AssignedQuests
Knights - Keeps and Quests - Vault have to be created first then Assigned Quests 

Many to Many
We already have User so models will need corresponding controllers to deal with http requests for:
User - already done by Mark / Jake
Keep - a pin
Vault - a board
Base - of all things


Repositories?
The repository is responsible for querying the database and writing information to the database
Create a Repository - establish an IDBConnection, Register our Repository connect with startup.cs
The repository talks to the database and issues the basic crud operations that we want to perform 
against the database.
The repository is all about connecting and instructing the db, it should not be involved in 
logic operations.  Logic operations is for the service layer.

Connect Controller to Service, Service to Repository, and Repository uses its Idb connection to talk to the 
database.


Keeps dont feed into the vaults aka pins dont feed into boards - pizza shack?
If a keep is viewed, add a counter for it - edit via CRUD post get put delete - in this case put will edit it
Will need a vue for boards 
Add Transient from all respoitories into startup.cs
That may include ItemRepository and ItemService such as:
services.AddTransient<KnightsRepository>();
serviecs.AddTransient<KnightsService>();
services.AddTransient<QuestsRepository>();
serviecs.AddTransient<QuestService>();

Jake's Breadcrumbs
Pizza Shack:
We accept an order object from the client an order request, and from that we build an order object,
so we decide what an order request is and build the order object in response.
1) Build out the request class - we will not save the whole request into the database, just the order
results will come into the database.  we will put that result into the orders model as the helper class 
aka the OrderRequest.
